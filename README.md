### About me:

Mechatronics engineer graduated at CEFET-MG (bachelor, 2021), software engineer with experience in WEB development (full-stack) and DevOps/SRE. I'm currently enrolled on a post-graduation program (Lato Sensu) at FIA Business School: Post-graduation on Software Engineering and Architecture.

My first stack related to web development was based on JavaScript, namely, React JS for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend. During a short time, I have also worked with Angular JS (Angular 1) and Vue.js for the frontend.

Other than straight software engineering, for some time I worked leading a small DevSecOps team, responsible for the cloud infrastructure, automations, CI/CD, reliability, finops, etc, at a startup/small company. There I also needed to make some short presentations in order to enhance the security culture inside the company. Those were called "Sec Talks".

Nowadays, I'm working most using the functional programming paradigm, leveraging F# (.NET platform) to solve real world problems.

Why F#? Because:

* There's a strong company backing it (Microsoft); 
* It's built on top of a solid platform that is already battle proved (.NET), and it's evolving, constantly being updated and enhanced;
* Great ecosystem (tools and people);
* Powerful type system (make illegal states unrepresentable - [Effective ML Revisited](https://blog.janestreet.com/effective-ml-revisited/));
* Decent performance ([F# for Performance-Critical Code, by Matthew Crews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ5Lwzrdoe8&ab_channel=JetBrains)).

I'm passionate about technology in general, and I really like to study and learn new things. Actually living at Minas Gerais, Brazil.

### Main experience with those languages/frameworks/tools :computer:

* Base: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla) and Typescript;
