### Hi, my name is VinÃ­cius Gajo ðŸ‘‹

> Searching for the Truth, the Beauty and the Goodness.

### About me:

Mechatronics engineer graduated at CEFET-MG (bachelor, 2021), and post-graduated
on Software Engineering and Architecture from FIA Business School (Lato Sensu,
2024). I'm actually a software engineer with experience in WEB development
(full-stack), functional programming, a bit of security and networks, cloud
infrastructure and DevOps/SRE.

Other than straight software engineering (IC), for some time I worked leading a
small DevSecOps team, responsible for the cloud infrastructure, automations,
CI/CD, reliability, finops, etc, at a startup. There I also needed to make some
short presentations in order to enhance the security culture inside the
company. Those were called "Sec Talks".

Nowadays, I'm working most using the functional programming paradigm, leveraging
F# (.NET platform) and SQL to solve real world problems.

Why F#? Because:

* There's a strong company backing it (Microsoft); 
* It's built on top of a solid platform that is already battle proved (.NET), and it's evolving, constantly being updated and enhanced;
* Great ecosystem (tools and people);
* Powerful type system (make illegal states unrepresentable - [Effective ML Revisited](https://blog.janestreet.com/effective-ml-revisited/));
* Decent performance ([F# for Performance-Critical Code, by Matthew Crews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ5Lwzrdoe8&ab_channel=JetBrains)).

I'm passionate about technology, engineering, classical philosophy and
theology. And when not studying about these subjects, I try to contribute to the
open-source community (if you'd like to start contributing to FOSS projects and
you're feeling lost, I wrote [this article](https://gaio.dev/posts/2022-09-18-foss-contributions) that could be
useful).

Actually living at Minas Gerais, Brazil.
