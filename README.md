### Hi, my name is VinÃ­cius Gajo ðŸ‘‹

[Read this in portuguese](https://github.com/64J0/64J0/blob/master/64J0-pt.md).

### About me:

Mechatronic engineer graduated at CEFET-MG, software developer with experience in WEB (full-stack). I'm 23 years old and passionate about technology, always trying to learn new things and get updated by making contributions in open source projects. Actually living in Brazil.

In my career, I've started as a mechanical designer in a internship at [Full Engenharia](http://fullengenharia.com.br/) where then I took my first steps as a FullStack WEB developer using the *Omnistack* (ReactJS in the front-end, Node.js in the back-end and MongoDB as the database). Later I've worked as a NOC Analyst (*Network Operations Center*) at [Master Internet](https://www.soumaster.com.br/), where I could learn a lot about telecommunications and networks (internet providers).

After some time I've started searching a development job and started working as a Full-stack developer at [JMV Technology](https://jmvtechnology.com/), working in some very interesting projects using lots of techs. At this place I had the oportunity to work with AngularJS (Angular 1), Vue 2 and React (class components) for the front-end and Node.js with Express and relational databases in the back-end.
